Specification Goals
===================
- Potential for low latency round trip times with a computer in the loop
- Potential for high-bandwidth, bidirectional communication (thousands of
  neural data channels; multiple high-resolution cameras)
- Acquisition and control of arbitrary of hardware components using a common
  computer interface

  - Support generic mixes of data sources and sinks from multiple,
    asynchronous pieces of hardware
  - Generic, system-wide hardware configuration
  - Generic, system-wide, bidirectional data streaming

- Support for multiple acquisition systems on one computer
- Hardware synchronization of multiple systems on a single host computers or
  across multiple host computers
- Cross platform
- Aimed at the creation of interoperable physical devices, gateware, firmware,
  and APIs
