========================================
Open Neuro Interface
========================================
ONI is a hardware development specification taylored to the needs of
experimental neuroscience along with a corresponding programming interface to
support **arbitrary mixtures of sensors, probes, and actuators**. The hope is
that this specification will streamline the development of new hardware for
neural data acquisition and guarantee interoperability between hardware and
software that conforms to the specification. We also hope that the use of a
common protocols will allow easy integration of disparate hardware to develop
rich feedback control loops for neuroscience projects. If you are interested in
developing against this specification (e.g.Â for a miniscope, headstage,
position tracker, 2P microscope, etc) or improving it, we would love to `hear
from you <https://open-ephys.org/contact>`__ and talk about the best way to
proceed.

Contents
--------
ONI is comprised of a hardware specification and a corresponding, open-source
API:

#. :ref:`Open Neuro Interface Hardware Specification <oni-hw>`: Create hardware
   that is compatible for the ONI API.
#. :ref:`Open Neuro Interface API Specification <oni-api>`: ONI API reference
   implementation for ONI-compliant hardware.

Contributing
------------
The main branch contains the stable version of the specification. The unstable
work in progress version can be found in the branch indicating the version.
