========================================
Open Neuro Interface
========================================
ONI is a hardware specification and API that facilitiates that creation of
tools for neural data acquisition. This standard allows the creation of neural
recording devices that support **arbitrary mixtures of sensors, probes, and
actuators**. The hope is that ONI will streamline the development of new
hardware for neural data acquisition and guarantee interoperability between
ONI-compliant hardware and software. We also hope that the use of a common
protocols will allow easy integration of disparate hardware to develop rich
feedback control loops for neuroscience projects. If you are interested in
developing against this specification (e.g.Â for a miniscope, headstage,
position tracker, 2P microscope, etc) or improving it, we would love to `hear
from you <https://open-ephys.org/contact>`__ and talk about the best way to
proceed.

Contents
--------

:ref:`oni-hw`
    Create ONI-compliant hardware.

:ref:`oni-api`
    Create software for controlling ONI-compliant hardware.

The main branch contains the stable version of the specification. The unstable
work in progress version can be found in the branch indicating the version.
